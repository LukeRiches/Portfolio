          Throughout my time at Northcoders I was introduced to many coding
          principles such as version control through Git and GitHub. The
          language which has been the foundation to everything I have learnt so
          far is JavaScript, run through Node.JS. Test Driven Development,
          through Jest, is an integral principal that leads my development to
          guarantee a high standard of code.

          So far my frontend development has centred around React, leveraging it
          with packages like react-dom, react-router-dom, and react spinners.
          Complemented by a solid understanding of HTML and DOM manipulation, I
          prioritise crafting seamless user interfaces and engaging user
          experiences.
          <br />
          <br />
          Recognising the pivotal role of UI/UX design in user engagement, I
          emphasise its importance in every project. I am attuned to the
          significance of accessibility, employing semantic HTML and tab
          controls to ensure inclusivity. Rigorous testing using tools like
          Lighthouse is integral to guaranteeing a high standard of
          accessibility in all my applications.

          Through JavaScript and PostgreSQL I can build RESTful APIâ€™s that
          feature essential CRUD operations and follow an MVC build pattern.
          Frameworks are built with express and makes use of node-postgres.
          Secured through pg-format to prevent SQL injection. Includes built-in
          and custom error handling as well as pagination.
          <br />
          <br />
          Throughout the build I maintain a commitment to rigorous testing,
          utilising dotenv for testing environments. Once hosted endpoints are
          tested through Insomnia, ensuring the reliability.

          This has always been something that has sparked my curiosity due to
          video games dominating my childhood, but I always felt it would be too
          complex to attempt. So having created a game it feels surreal, my
          introduction to game development was through Phaser which applied
          concepts like Object Orientated Programming. Another part I really
          enjoyed was Sprite work which has furthered my respect for games
          artists.This is something I thoroughly enjoy and will continue.
